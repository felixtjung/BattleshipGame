# First Build

1. Please Open BattleShipGame.sln with visual studio
2. Right click on BattleshipGame/package.json and click "Restore Packages"
3. After that, the csproj should run the typescript unit test and compile correctly.


# Important Files

Scripts/BattleshipBoard.ts - contains the implementation of BattleshipBoard logic.

Scripts/Tests/BattleshipBoardTest.ts - contains the unit tests for BattleshipBoard logic.

# Output Files

Scripts/BattleshipBoard.ts will be compiled and written to output directory wwwroot/js/compiled (So, the compiled js file doesn't need be added to git).


# Special Notes

The typescript unit tests are executed as pre-build event. So, if the typescript unit test failed, the build will also failed.

To run the unit test manually, please use "npm run test" within the same directory of the package.json file.
